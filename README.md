# React + Vite
# Steps doing the project
 Went to https://api.nasa.gov to get free API Key
Read through documentation to find out what information I wanted to retrieve in my app. Once I figured that out, look for base URL and endpoint
Determined what and how I wanted the data displayed based on directions given for project
Mapped out what components and pages were needed
Created app using npm create vite@latest
Installed React Router using npm install react-router-dom
Created components and pages
Once components and pages are created, created broilerplate code for each using (rfce)
Imported needed components into App.jsx or wherever they are going to be used
In main.jsx, wrapped Router component around App component

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
